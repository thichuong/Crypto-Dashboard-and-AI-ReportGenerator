Translate HTML content from Vietnamese to English

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep ALL HTML tags, CSS classes, IDs, and structure exactly the same unless otherwise specified below.
- Only translate text content inside the tags. Do not translate code, attribute values, IDs, classes, or comments except where explicitly requested.
- Preserve all formatting, spacing, and indentation.
- Do not add, remove, or modify any HTML attributes.
- Maintain the exact same structure.

ADDITIONAL PROJECT-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT:
- For every chart container ID used in the report (for example `fear-greed-gauge-container`, `btc-dominance-doughnut-container`, `price-line-chart-container`, `volume-bar-chart-container`), REPLACE the original ID with a translated-English variant by appending the suffix `-en` to the ID. That means the English fragment should contain chart containers with IDs suffixed by `-en` (for example `fear-greed-gauge-container-en`). 
- IMPORTANT: Remove the original chart container IDs (without `-en` suffix) from the English fragment. The English version should only contain the `-en` suffixed IDs for chart containers to avoid duplicate IDs in the document.

Content to translate (follow the rules above):
